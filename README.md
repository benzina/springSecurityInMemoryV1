In addition, we will have role based restricted access to some particular pages. 
On the one hand, some pages will be accessible to multiple roles and on the other hand some with no restrictions(accessible to all roles).
Moreover, we will use thymeleaf to create pages. Additionally, we will have a controller class to serve the userâ€™s request. 
this application is developped by a code  Before Spring Security 5.7.0
